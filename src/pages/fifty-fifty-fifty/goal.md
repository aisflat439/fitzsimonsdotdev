title: "The 50, 50, 50"
---

When I was 40, I was in the best shape of my life. Then, I moved to Colorado and started living a life that has been better than I ever expected. My fitness is still good, although not as good. Mostly, I've met all the goals I had by this age. My outcomes are a combination of tremendous good luck and hard work. However, I do have a few goals I'd like to meet by the time I'm fifty. For now, I'm calling it the 50, 50, 50.

50 pull-ups and 100 push-ups
Run a 50k
Sell a business for 50k

If I can pull all these off, I'll be heading into retirement at a healthy weight, very fit, and capable of making money online. In theory, that means I can retire around 55 and do things like hike the Appalachian Trail. Go on a variety of adventures with my wife. Create a business that keeps me curious and invigorated intellectually.

For 50 pull-ups, the goal is to do them as close to strict as possible, ideally unbroken. If I flail the last five, I don't really care. But the first 30 should be tight. I can do 4 strict right now. At my peak, I've been able to do 10 strict pull-ups. I probably need to lose about 10 pounds and put on some muscle. I'll need to be very lean and eat well.

Run a 50k. No time goal here other than it's a run, not a run walk. I've run 5k's but never a marathon. I have hiked that distance, so I'm confident about being able to achieve this. The actual goal here is not to get hurt. To run 50k at 50, I'll need to be able to take that kind of pounding on my legs. I'll need to put in volume. That's never been a skill of mine. However, the average marathon training plan takes about six months. So this will be infinitely achievable.

Sell a business for 50k. I have spent most of my life as a want-repenuer. I've gotten closer to getting off the sidelines and into entrepreneurship, but in this domain so far, I'm a failure. Selling a business for 50k will be a massive challenge. However, I don't think it's impossible. The number one thing it will take is discipline.

In fact, discipline is what all these goals will take. That's going to be the real trick. I've struggled a lot with discipline. Finishing has always been a struggle. Here's hoping that picking an absurd goal will help me focus and be consistent. LFG.
