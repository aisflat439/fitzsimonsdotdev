Around the year 2000, the experience of walking into a Whole Foods Market was markedly different from entering your local grocery store. Whole Foods eventually sold for $13 billion. If this had been a tech company growing, finding product-market fit, scaling, and selling, the tech world would be ablaze, discussing how their management style spurred this tremendous success. However, the insights from operating a wildly successful grocery store haven't permeated the tech industry. Despite the success coming from a hyper-competitive, low-margin sector, tech continues to prioritize a MBA-first approach, leveraging data, agile methodologies, cross-functional teams, and constant reporting, rather than empowering local teams to do the work. The tech industry moves fastâ€”Web 2.0, Rails, and later React each took the industry by storm. Yet, we predominantly cling to Agile as the framework for running our companies and developing features.

## Tech isn't organic

"Technology isn't groceries," your data analyst may object. "We need Agile because of the twelve principles..." your scrum master or Agile coach might say. Meanwhile, as they collect their six-figure salaries, a 22-year-old is figuring out how to merchandise yogurt to eke out an extra 1% in sales right now for $18 an hour. Maybe they went to college, possibly for Art History, and they might have even finished. Yet, they still possess an intuitive understanding of how to grow a key metric like sales, especially when success could mean receiving a bonus.

The great myth of the tech industry is its uniqueness. It was unique when the Agile Manifesto was written in 2001. Back then, software was often delivered once, unlike the instant version updates the web allows today. This historical context is crucial. Now, software users have likely interacted with various software before. They may have used a different CRM or ERP but are familiar with the basics. Software has become ubiquitous, integrated into our lives to the extent that we don't really give it a second thought. This shifts the benchmark for software from merely functioning to being good.

"Good" is a spectrum. Walmart is good. Whole Foods is good. The grocer around the corner from your house is also good. Each of these stores understands its identity. We can draw parallels with web tech. In this analogy, Automattic might be Walmart, quietly earning significant profits and powering around 40% of the web. Netflix could be likened to Whole Foods pre-acquisition, now navigating a challenging industry after once dominating and gaining a substantial lead. Regardless, these companies have become ubiquitous, with customers selecting what's best for them. Where you work, the company is striving to become a version of Whole Foods, Walmart, or the neighborhood grocery store, each offering a distinct value proposition. Perhaps it's sleek and modern, or maybe it's simple and accessible to anyone.

What this all suggests is that, like your favorite grocery store, we can move past the charade of maintaining numerous peculiar layers and wasting time on "data-driven insights."
