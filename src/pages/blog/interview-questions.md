### Who would you credit for helping you get to where you are now?

### Can you tell us about a time you’ve had to mediate a conflict in your team?

### Tell us about a recent time where you helped somebody at work without being asked?

When I joined [MEGA_CORP], the React project was quite a few versions behind. The React team chose to deprecate Enzyme in favor of React Testing Library in React 16. Enzyme tests have a few disadvantages to RTL (React Testing Library). They're more verbose. It's easy to make a brittle test as they lend themselves to testing internals, rather than UI. Of course, they're also deprecated and will need to be re-written.

It was in my first week when I found this out. I DM'd the lead and asked if I could install the needed libraries for RTL. He said sure, as long as I can get everything to work with the existing app. Luckily, That was extremely straightforward. I quickly wrote the tests and presented a draft PR to the team. In the PR, I highlighted a couple of the things that I'd done. I then offered via DM to host a quick walk-through of how RTL works if anyone wanted.

I left out my opinions about never writing deprecated code and how to evolve a codebase from Enzyme to RTL. I was brand new to the team. It seemed to me, given the state of the codebase and the fact that I didn't yet know the goals of the project, that setting a decent pattern that could be copy-pasted and making myself open for questions and a presentation would be the ideal level of impact.
