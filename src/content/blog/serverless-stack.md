## Serverless Stack

For the last year or so I've been focused on trying to learn serverless. I'm dreadful at full stack. I've tried Serverless Framework and Amplify and they are awesome tools. For me, the thing I want, more than anything, is a single stack I can run, where I can see how all my work fits together. Serverless Stack fits that bill for me, while those others didn't quite hit the mark. I also really like serverless stacks tutorial focus. The project is supported by <a href="www.seed.run" rel="no-follow" target="_blank">Seed.run</a> which helps manage deployments. Another thing I'm terrible at. So this seems like the stack for me, at least for a little while. This project runs around Amazons CDK which seems like, the right build pattern for me.
