Just making sure that this works as I expect

# What am I doing?

One of the goals for this year that I've set is to do 100 days of code three times. I'll be able to update the topic from one thing to another of course. But, the goal is to do 100 days, working towards the thing I'm trying to learn. I'm starting with Serverless. Essentially, I'll be doing 100 days of serverless, rather than 100 days of code. If i'm being fully honest I don't actually have enough time in the day to pull this off. As a result, I'll be biting off small chunks, perhaps comically small, where I'll update and discuss what I learned, what I did, and why I did it each day. We'll see how it goes. 

## Questions? 

I guess the biggest unknown that I have is should I do 100 days of serverless or Amplify. That remains unclear at this time. Todays "achievement" is basically getting this url up. Not even linking it to the header or anything. So a pretty small goal to say the least.
